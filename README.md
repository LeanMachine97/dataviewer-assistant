## Model Providers

This template ships with OpenAI `gpt-4o` as the default. However, with the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.


## Running locally

You will need to update the environment variables defined in [`.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot.


```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
